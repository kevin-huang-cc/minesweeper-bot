## Minesweeper Bot by Kevin

This is a project done by Kevin that solves the minesweeper game. Here are some of the libraries included:

* pygetwindow, mss and PIL for Image recognition to convert pixel to number
* Data processing and analysis, logic for calculating blocks that can be deduced from a given state
* pyautogui for Mouse manipulation to achieve the auto-solving process

## Note
This project urrently only works on Minesweeper app on MacOS. Restricted by refresh rate so currently added time.sleep, looking for better and more efficient solution.
